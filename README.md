# World GDP Analysis

## Overview
This project involves an in-depth analysis of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data sourced from the World Bank Group, which was obtained from the Kaggle dataset [here]([link-to-the-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sazidthe1/world-gdp-data)). The goal is to gain insights into the economic performance of countries, regions, and income groups over several decades, from 1960 to 2022. The project combines SQL data querying and visualization using Tableau Public to present key findings.

### Data Sources
The project utilizes two primary datasets:

- **GDP Data:** Contains country-specific GDP values, years, and unique country codes.
- **Country Codes Data:** Provides country regions and income group classifications, facilitating multifaceted analysis.

### Key Questions Explored
The project seeks to analyze five areas:

1. **Trend in Global GDP (1960-2022):**
   - The global GDP has exhibited a clear upward trend from 1960 to 2022.
   - There have been fluctuations and periods of slower growth, often linked to economic crises or global events.
   - Significant growth phases were observed in the 1990s and the early 2000s, likely due to technological advancements and globalization.
   - The global financial crisis in 2008 had a substantial impact, causing a temporary dip in global GDP growth.
   - In recent years, factors such as trade tensions, the COVID-19 pandemic, and supply chain disruptions have led to fluctuations in global GDP growth.

2. **Countries with Highest GDP in 2022:**
   - The countries with the highest GDP in 2022 include the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and India.
   - The United States maintained its position as the world's largest economy, with China in the second position.

3. **Region with Highest GDP in 2022:**
   - In 2022, North America, driven primarily by the United States, had the highest GDP among regions.
   - Asia, led by China and India, also contributes significantly to the global GDP.
   - Europe, with countries like Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, has a strong presence in the global economy.
   
4. **Average GDP Growth Rate for Low-Income Countries (1960-2022):**
   - Low-income countries have experienced an increase in their average GDP growth rate from 1960 to 2022.
   - Growth rates for low-income countries can be highly volatile, but they have generally trended upwards.

5. **GDP of a Specific Country Over Time (e.g., United States):**
   - The GDP of the United States has shown steady growth over the decades, making it one of the world's largest economies.
   - There were periods of rapid growth, such as the post-World War II era and the technology-driven boom in the late 20th century.
   - The United States also faced economic downturns, including the Great Recession in 2008, but it demonstrated resilience in recovery.
   - The COVID-19 pandemic led to a temporary decline in GDP, but a strong rebound is expected.

### Tools and Technologies
- **SQL:** Data analysis is performed using SQL queries to extract and manipulate the dataset.
- **Tableau Public:** Data visualizations are created in Tableau Public to provide clear and interactive insights. You can view the visualizations [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ryan.outerson/viz/GDPGrowthComparison/GDPGrowthComparison).
- **GitHub:** The project code and documentation are hosted on GitHub for easy collaboration and sharing.

### Findings and Visualizations
The project includes visualizations generated using Tableau Public to present key findings. These visualizations help convey trends, rankings, and comparisons, making complex economic data more accessible and understandable.
