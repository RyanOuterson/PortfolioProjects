# World GDP Analysis

## Overview

This project involves an in-depth analysis of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data sourced from the World Bank Group, which was obtained from the Kaggle dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sazidthe1/world-gdp-data). The goal is to gain insights into the economic performance of countries, regions, and income groups over several decades, from 1960 to 2022. The project combines SQL data querying and visualization using Tableau Public to present key findings.

## Data Sources

The project utilizes two primary datasets:

1. **GDP Data**: Contains country-specific GDP values, years, and unique country codes.
2. **Country Codes Data**: Provides country regions and income group classifications, facilitating multifaceted analysis.

## Key Questions Explored

The project seeks to analyze five areas:

1. **Trend in Global GDP (1960-2022)**: Analyze the global GDP trend over the decades to identify patterns and fluctuations.
   
2. **Countries with Highest GDP in 2022**: Identify and rank the countries with the highest GDP in the most recent year available, which is 2022.

3. **Region with Highest GDP in 2022**: Determine which region has the highest GDP in 2022, providing insights into regional economic performance.

4. **Average GDP Growth Rate for Low-Income Countries (1960-2022)**: Calculate and analyze the average GDP growth rate for low-income countries from 1960 to 2022, offering insights into their long-term economic progress.

5. **GDP of a Specific Country Over Time (e.g., United States)**: Examine how the GDP of a specific country, such as the United States, has changed over the years, offering insights into both historical and recent economic trends.

## Tools and Technologies

- **SQL**: Data analysis is performed using SQL queries to extract and manipulate the dataset.
- **Tableau Public**: Data visualizations are created in Tableau Public to provide clear and interactive insights.
- **GitHub**: The project code and documentation are hosted on GitHub for easy collaboration and sharing.

## Findings and Visualizations

The project includes visualizations generated using Tableau Public to present key findings. These visualizations help convey trends, rankings, and comparisons, making complex economic data more accessible and understandable.
